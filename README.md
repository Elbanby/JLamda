# Java Lambda
This repo is intended to demonstrate how to use lambda expressions and its features.

I am using these examples on my presentation for "10 minutes of art & lambdas"

## Special Thanks
This presentation references lots of the teachings from:

1- Venkat Subramaniam on his talk "Get a Taste of Lambdas and Get Addicted to Streams"

2- Luis Santiago on his Medium blog post
"How to start working with Lambda Expressions in Java"
